<meta name=keywords content><meta name=description content="1. Decoy Effect:

Often people don&rsquo;t know what they want until these see things in context. Everything is relevant.
we are always looking at things in relation to others. A perceived size of circle changes based on whether it&rsquo;s placed among other smaller circles or bigger circles
This is the reason why a print+online subscription is the best seller when you have a decoy option like print only for almost the same price
We take the decision based on what we do know - print +online for 150$ is better than print only for 125$
Introducing a new most expensive entree in a restaurant menu improves the sale of next most expensive entree
&ldquo;A man&rsquo;s satisfaction with his salary depends on whether he makes more than his wife&rsquo;s sister&rsquo;s husband&rdquo;

2. Arbitrary Coherence:

Second price auction?
The first seen price in a new product category serves as an anchor - as long as you seriously contemplate to buy it.
This is same reason why people are initially not willing to pay higher rents when they move to expensive cities even when their wages are calibrated
These anchors have an enduring affect and we see ourselves coming back to this anchor diet comparison


The cost of zero cost


Zero is the source of emotional excitement
Every transaction has an upside and a downside. Free transactions gives the illusion that there’s bio downside. Our high inclination to loss aversion makes it far more attractive than it actually is
Amazon saw an increase in AOV when it introduced free shipping above 20$. They saw this increase everywhere except in France where they charged a reduced fee of 20 cents for these high value orders
Zero is not another discount, it’s a place. Difference between 2 and 1 is small. But the difference between 1 and zero is huge

4. Social and Market norms

People might work more for a cause than cash
There are 2 different worlds we live in. One where market norms apply and one where social norms apply
Once social norm meets the market norm, social norm goes away for a long long time

5. Influence of arousal

Our inability to understand ourselves doesn’t improve with experience

6. Problem of procrastination and self control

Resisting temptation and instilling self control are general human goals, and repeatedly failing to achieve them is the source of much of our misery
Road to hell is paved with good intentions
Pre commitment (self imposed challenge) is one tool that solves this

7. The high price of ownership

When we own something, we start to value it more than others
Students who won a lottery to a basketball game were willing to sell it at 2400$ while while students who didn’t make the lottery were willing to buy at only 170$
We fall in love for what we already have
In case of large transactions, approach it as if you are a non-owner

8. Why options distract us from iit main objective

Studies have shown that When given options, even if we know the expected value of each of these options, we still choose to explore 🤷🏻‍♂️

9. The effect of expectations

Previously held impressions affect the interpretation
If you tell people in advance that something might be distasteful, odds are good that they will agree with you - because of their expectations

10. The power of price

Price/cost can act as placebo

12. Why dealing with cash makes us more honest:

When the opportunity to cheat is in context of something that’s a few steps removed, or even one step removed from actual cash, we all cheat, to a greater extent at that
This is the reason why you see flagrant cheating in insurance claims, backdating stock options, audit books
In these scenarios, we tend to rationalize and be dishonest by telling ourselves that e we are not being dishonest

13. Beer and Free lunches

When we order out loud in sequence, we tend to order a drink different to what others ordered on table
