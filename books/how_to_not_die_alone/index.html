<meta name=keywords content><meta name=description content="GETTING READY

Modern dating is tough. Unlimited access to information had tricked us into believing that there&rsquo;s certainty in everything. We often end up searching for that perfect match
It&rsquo;s harder to build a long lasting relationship when you lack relationship role models
Dating Blindspots:

The Romanticizer:

Traditionally marriages were seldom for love. Marriage was about economics and convenience


The Maximiser:

Maximisers make good decisions and ends up feeling bad about them. Satisficers make good decisions and end up feeling good
Satisficers figure out what they want and stop looking once they have met their criteria.  They don&rsquo;t settle. They merely stop worrying what else is out there once they have made their decision
Satisficers tend to be happier because in the end, happiness comes from how you feel about your decision, not the decision itself.


The Hesitator:

Deadlines usually work
Commit to your new identities. Small nudges towards an identity can make you own it
The group that was asked &lsquo;how important is it to you to be a voter&rsquo; turned up for voting more than (11%) the group which was asked &lsquo;how important is it to you to vote&rsquo;. People who were nudged to think of themselves as voters were more likely to follow through on their plans





LEARN YOUR ATTACHMENT STYLE

There are 3 kinds of attachments:

Anxiously attached, avoidantly attached, securely attached


Some books that are written on this: Attached by Amir levine and Rachel heller and Hold me tight by Sue Johnson
Experiment: First, a mother and baby enter the room and baby feels confident to play with the toys. Then mother leaves the room and comes back a little later. Following is observed

Anxiously attached: Some babies cried immediately after their mother left and then when mother returns and tries to soothe the baby, the baby pushes mother away and continues to cry
Securely attached: Some babies cried when mother left and stopped as soon as she returned and resumed playing
Avoidantly attached: Third group did not respond to their mother leaving the room nor acknowledged her coming back. They pretended they were not impacted by the situation but their heart rate went up showing distress


Anxiously attached:

Want to be constantly attached with their partners.
These people&rsquo;s brains are flooded with activating strategies.
They tend to overvalue their partner&rsquo;s good qualities and under value theirs. This leads to panic. And when they don&rsquo;t hear back from their partners immediately, they worry they are being abandoned.
They shake off their anxiety only when they are actively communicating with their partner.
They tend to jump into relationships and stay past it&rsquo;s expiration. Coz they fear being alone and that this is their only shot at love.
They act out to get their attention. Constantly call or threaten to leave or ignore phone calls.


Avoidantly attached:

They try to minimize the pain of rejection by pretending they don&rsquo;t actually want to connect. When intimacy increases, they try to pull away
They engage deactivating strategies. I&rsquo;m not ready to commit, My job is really demanding to see other people etc.
They tend to dwell on partner&rsquo;s partner&rsquo;s bad qualities and use it as a reason to exit the relationship


Securely attached:

They make ideal partners. They are reliable and trustworthy. They tend to avoid drama or be able to defuse it when they see it coming
They create healthy boundaries, good at communicating, comfortable with intimacy
They make up 50% of general population, but are far fewer in dating pool as they tend to get into relationships and stay in them


Anxious avoidant loop:

Avoidantly attached people are so good at pushing people away that the only time they end up in a relationship is if the other person is persistent.


Tips:

Try to date a secure partner. A person who doesn&rsquo;t play games, tells you what&rsquo;s on their mind, avoids or de-escalate drama.



HOW TO NOT LOOK FOR A PROM DATE

Nothing in life is as important as you think it is while you are thinking about it - Kahneman. Merely thinking about something accentuates the differences. (Focusing illusion)
Think in terms of if you will have a good ‘life story’ with this person. Not a good ‘love story’
We always acclimatize. Even if you marry the most attractive person, you will get used to how they look.
A big part of our sex drive is associated with novelty. So no matter how hot your partner is, that initial pleasure will fade
Physical attraction can obscure long term compatibility. Pay attention on whether you are attracted to that person Vs whether society perceives them to be attractive
Similar personality is not a predictor of long term relationship success

What’s the key? It’s fine to have different interests, as long as it doesn’t preclude you from investing time in your relationship. You should give each other space and time to explore them on their own.
Does oral birth control alter the type of partner you are sexually attracted to?


Expectation from partner:

Modern couples often assume that they can get all of their needs met by their partner. They expect this one person to wear almost all of the hats.
Having multiple people you can turn to fire your emotional needs rather than 1 or 2 increases your overall well being
A Good Relationship tip: Consider what roles you have asked your partner to play that they are uninterested in fulfilling. Just because they don’t share all your interests doesn’t make them a bad partner. For these roles, turn to your friends and family.



WHAT MATTERS MORE THAN WHAT WE THINK:

Emotional stability and kindness are two of the most important and underrated characteristics needed for a good relationship

Emotional stability is measured based on how one reacts in stressful situations. Do they take time to think and respond or do they act impulsively and react.
“Between stimulus and response is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom” - Victor Franco


Loyalty. You want someone who will stay with through think and thin. Old friendships in general indicate loyalty.
Growth mindset. A person with growth mindset doesn’t assume that talent is assigned at birth. They are much more likely to fight for the relationship when the problems eventually arise. Someone with growth mindset talks to themselves with self compassion
Personality that brings out the best in you. How to evaluate? See how you feel after a date with them - energized, deflated, bored, desired, happy etc. After you go out with friends and her, ask your friends what do you think of me around her.
Skill to fight well. There are 2 types of problems. Solvable and perpetual. Key is to find a productive way to live with perpetual problems. Remember, when you choose a partner, you automatically choose a particular set of unreasonable problems.

GETTING OUT THERE

Show a metric to people, they will think that’s important. People eventually try to optimize for the metrics we measure.
Date smarter

Change your dating filters. Be more open minded on whom the dating app shows you
Swipe right on people who might be a maybe


What works for your dating profile:

Candid photos outperform posed by 15%
BnW photos outperform by 100% 😱
For guys, have a standing photo looking into the camera smiling without teeth
A good profile should represent you, not an aspirational version of you


HOW TO MEET PEOPLE IRL

Go to events. Evaluate events on these 2 metrics. 1. Likelihood that you will enjoy the event. 2. Likelihood that you will interact with people
Talk to people when standing in line


How to create better dates

Have a pre date ritual
Choose some place sexier. Like a candle lit wine bar instead of a well lit cafe
Try sitting next to rather than across. It’s easier to open up when you are not making eye contact
Look for a fun activity to do together. A third object takes the pressure off.
Go on dates where you can see your date interact with others. Or where you need to collaborate like solving a puzzle.  This is a great way to observe those hard to measure qualities. More date ideas on loganury.com
On talking during dates: try entering with the middle part of story - instead of asking how is your day going, say something like ‘I just got off phone with my sister and she’s in the middle of an intense battle with her landlord’ - a shortcut to intimacy
focus more on being interested than being interesting
People usually judge an experience based on how they felt during the most intense moment in the experience and at the end. So, order a dessert at the end or make a meaningful compliment just before you part ways
Support Vs shift responses
The post date aid - instead of having checklist, ask yourself following questions:

What side of me did they bring out
How did my body feel during the date - stiff, relax or something in between
Do I feel energized or de-energized after the date
Is there something about them that I’m curious about
Did they make me laugh
Did I feel heard
Did I feel attractive in their presence
Did I feel captivated or bored or something in between




Make going on 2nd dates a default rather than an exception

GETTING SERIOUS

Decide, don&rsquo;t slide. It’s important to define the relationship (DTR) from time to time.
Move deliberately and ensure other person is onboard with your expectations and understanding of the relationship
Take the wardrobe test of you are planning to break up. Answer to the following question should be quick and be coming out of gut feeling

If your partner were to be a piece of clothing in your wardrobe, what would they be?
It’s usually a good sign if they are a fav shirt, or something like a jacket or shoes


Book Recommendation: The Artist’s way - an inspirational book that helps you reconnect with yourself
Read the appropriate parts of the books for following things:

How to decide if you should break up
How to break up with someone
How to overcome heartbreak


How to decide if you should marry?

Go through the series of self reflection and conversational questions Logan suggests in the book before deciding
We usually are so fond of each other that we assume other person wants the same things as them and never talk about major decisions like where to live or to have kids
