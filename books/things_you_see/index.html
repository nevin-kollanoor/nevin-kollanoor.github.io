<meta name=keywords content><meta name=description content="REST

It&rsquo;s not that the world is objectively joyful or sad and produces the corresponding feeling in us. Feelings originate with the mind projecting it&rsquo;s subjective experience on to the world
Our reality is not the infinitely expanding cosmos. But the small part we choose to focus on.
It&rsquo;s not the situations that are troubling us, but our perspective on it. Tsunamies are terrifying not just because of the water, but because of the objects that are hurled at us. We feel unhappy not just because of what happened, but because of the swirling thoughts of what happened.
Don&rsquo;t struggle to heal your wounds. Just pour time into your heart and wait. When the wounds are ready, they will heal on their own.
Ask yourself how your work helps others regardless of how insignificantly or indirectly. As you focus more on others, you can reconnect with the meaning and purpose for your work
With love in our hearts, you will find the most mundane things beautiful. Without love in our hearts, we find the world meaningless, and random. Without love in our hearts, we will become strangers even to our family and friends.
Don&rsquo;t give up upon receiving criticism. Brush aside what people who don&rsquo;t know you have to say.
Life teaches us through our mistakes. When you make a mistake, simply ask yourself what you are meant to learn from it.

MINDFULNESS

When people who don&rsquo;t know you well admire you, they are seeing their projected illusion not your real self. In contrast when people who know you well respect you, it&rsquo;s probably because you deserve it
When you push back against an unchangeable no, you will suffer in the process and miss other opportunities
The entirety of an enlightened person can be summarized into &lsquo;complete acceptance to what is&rsquo;
Evaluating the present through the memories of the past can cause sadness. Change is inevitable, embrace it and welcome it.
Our consciousness may desire money, power and prestige. But the subconscious desires selfless love, harmony, humour, beauty, sacredness, peace and acceptance.

PASSION

It&rsquo;s a mistake to equate our own eagerness with effectiveness. Getting the job done well is more important than one&rsquo;s feeling a of doing a good job.
One&rsquo;s own zealous efforts can sometimes get in the way of achieving the desired outcome especially if one is not able to see the needs of others working together
It&rsquo;s dangerous to have passion without wisdom
A vow to help others can immense energy from inside
Many conflicts can be resolved if we try to look at things from the other&rsquo;s pov.
If you get angry while debating right and wrong, your enraged voice just conceded defeat.

RELATIONSHIPS

Conversations tend to become boring when we are in the clutches of politeness

LOVE

Be as gentle in ending a relationship, as you were starting it
Anger without reason, could be an indication of crush

LIFE

Write down the things that you want to do for yourself before you die and do it one by one. No one needs to know about it
Dream big, start small
Your thoughts become your words, words become your behavior, behaviors become your habits, your habits become your values and your values become your destiny. So keep them positive.
When our greed is awakened, we are cheated. Swindlers use this often
The reward for someone who works hard is more work
If we are quick to grant a favor, people quickly forget their gratitude. If we grant a favor with several conditions, then people express immense gratitude.

THE FUTURE

Live your life not to satisfy others, but to fulfill your own desires
Life isn&rsquo;t a 100 meter race against your friends, but a life long marathon against yourself. Don&rsquo;t be disappointed that you are slightly behind
When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself &ldquo;I will not spend today passively, doing what others ask me to do. I will take the lead and forge my own destiny&rdquo;.
Establish a goal for the week. A significant accomplishment can be traced back to a single thought.
About career choices - The truth is that other people do not really think about you that much. If you think you will enjoy something, don&rsquo;t overthink it. Just do it. Even if it doesn&rsquo;t turn out to be what you thought it would be, you will appreciate what it taught you.
