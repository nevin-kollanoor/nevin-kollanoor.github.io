      <title>Death Throes of the Republic - Dan Carlin</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;ep-1-the-gracchi-brothers&#34;&gt;Ep 1. The Gracchi Brothers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The wars which elevate Rome to superpower status also sow the seed for the downfall of its political system. Money, slaves, ambition, political stalemate and class warfare prove to be a toxic, bloody mix&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Republic came into existence from 509 BC and ended in 27 BC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roman society is kind of organised like a Mafia family.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rome saw crazy transformation in just a generation or two (Just like the US before and after World wars), with wealth brought in by the wars they fought -
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The three punic wars fought between Carthaginians (modern Tunisia) and Romans between 264 BC and 142 BC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Macedonian wars between Romans and Greek allies (importantly Seleucid empire) between 214 BC and 148 BC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Patrician class was top of the food chain in Rome. They ruled over people like Gods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tribune of Plebs were created (494 BC) to protect the interests of plebeians against the senate and magistrates, who were exclusively Patricians. This happened coz patricians needed plebeians to fight wars for them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There were 300 aristocratic senators in the senate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tribunes (10 in number) while in their power are completely protected in Rome. But their security is void when they step out of Rome or when their term ends&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Problem:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the last hundred years, there had been several wars. Since legionaries were required to serve in a complete campaign, no matter how long it was, soldiers often left their farms in the hands of wives and children. Small farms in this situation often went bankrupt and were bought up by the wealthy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tiberius Gracchus(166-133 BC), born to a wealthy influential family had an epiphany while travelling through he country side of Italy,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The beasts of the field and birds of the air have their holes and hiding places, but the men who fight and die for Italy only enjoy the light and air. Our  generals urge their soldiers to fight for the graves and shrines of their ancestors. You have no ancestral tomb. You fight and die to give wealth and luxury to others. You are called the masters of the world, but you do not have a foot of ground that you can call your own&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to not Die Alone - Logan Ury</title>
      <link>https://nevin-kollanoor.github.io/books/how_to_not_die_alone/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;getting-ready&#34;&gt;GETTING READY&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modern dating is tough. Unlimited access to information had tricked us into believing that there&amp;rsquo;s certainty in everything. We often end up searching for that perfect match&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s harder to build a long lasting relationship when you lack relationship role models&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dating Blindspots:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Romanticizer:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Traditionally marriages were seldom for love. Marriage was about economics and convenience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Maximiser:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maximisers make good decisions and ends up feeling bad about them. Satisficers make good decisions and end up feeling good&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Satisficers figure out what they want and stop looking once they have met their criteria.  They don&amp;rsquo;t settle. They merely stop worrying what else is out there once they have made their decision&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Satisficers tend to be happier because in the end, happiness comes from how you feel about your decision, not the decision itself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Hesitator:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deadlines usually work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commit to your new identities. Small nudges towards an identity can make you own it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The group that was asked &amp;lsquo;how important is it to you to be a voter&amp;rsquo; turned up for voting more than (11%) the group which was asked &amp;lsquo;how important is it to you to vote&amp;rsquo;. People who were nudged to think of themselves as voters were more likely to follow through on their plans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;learn-your-attachment-style&#34;&gt;LEARN YOUR ATTACHMENT STYLE&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are 3 kinds of attachments:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anxiously attached, avoidantly attached, securely attached&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some books that are written on this: Attached by Amir levine and Rachel heller and Hold me tight by Sue Johnson&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experiment: First, a mother and baby enter the room and baby feels confident to play with the toys. Then mother leaves the room and comes back a little later. Following is observed
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anxiously attached: Some babies cried immediately after their mother left and then when mother returns and tries to soothe the baby, the baby pushes mother away and continues to cry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Securely attached: Some babies cried when mother left and stopped as soon as she returned and resumed playing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoidantly attached: Third group did not respond to their mother leaving the room nor acknowledged her coming back. They pretended they were not impacted by the situation but their heart rate went up showing distress&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anxiously attached:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Want to be constantly attached with their partners.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These people&amp;rsquo;s brains are flooded with activating strategies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They tend to overvalue their partner&amp;rsquo;s good qualities and under value theirs. This leads to panic. And when they don&amp;rsquo;t hear back from their partners immediately, they worry they are being abandoned.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They shake off their anxiety only when they are actively communicating with their partner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They tend to jump into relationships and stay past it&amp;rsquo;s expiration. Coz they fear being alone and that this is their only shot at love.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They act out to get their attention. Constantly call or threaten to leave or ignore phone calls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoidantly attached:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They try to minimize the pain of rejection by pretending they don&amp;rsquo;t actually want to connect. When intimacy increases, they try to pull away&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They engage deactivating strategies. I&amp;rsquo;m not ready to commit, My job is really demanding to see other people etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They tend to dwell on partner&amp;rsquo;s partner&amp;rsquo;s bad qualities and use it as a reason to exit the relationship&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Securely attached:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They make ideal partners. They are reliable and trustworthy. They tend to avoid drama or be able to defuse it when they see it coming&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They create healthy boundaries, good at communicating, comfortable with intimacy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They make up 50% of general population, but are far fewer in dating pool as they tend to get into relationships and stay in them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anxious avoidant loop:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoidantly attached people are so good at pushing people away that the only time they end up in a relationship is if the other person is persistent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tips:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try to date a secure partner. A person who doesn&amp;rsquo;t play games, tells you what&amp;rsquo;s on their mind, avoids or de-escalate drama.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;how-to-not-look-for-a-prom-date&#34;&gt;HOW TO NOT LOOK FOR A PROM DATE&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nothing in life is as important as you think it is while you are thinking about it - Kahneman. Merely thinking about something accentuates the differences. (Focusing illusion)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Think in terms of if you will have a good ‘life story’ with this person. Not a good ‘love story’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We always acclimatize. Even if you marry the most attractive person, you will get used to how they look.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A big part of our sex drive is associated with novelty. So no matter how hot your partner is, that initial pleasure will fade&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Physical attraction can obscure long term compatibility. Pay attention on whether you are attracted to that person Vs whether society perceives them to be attractive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Similar personality is not a predictor of long term relationship success
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What’s the key? It’s fine to have different interests, as long as it doesn’t preclude you from investing time in your relationship. You should give each other space and time to explore them on their own.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does oral birth control alter the type of partner you are sexually attracted to?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expectation from partner:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modern couples often assume that they can get all of their needs met by their partner. They expect this one person to wear almost all of the hats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having multiple people you can turn to fire your emotional needs rather than 1 or 2 increases your overall well being&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Good Relationship tip: Consider what roles you have asked your partner to play that they are uninterested in fulfilling. Just because they don’t share all your interests doesn’t make them a bad partner. For these roles, turn to your friends and family.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;what-matters-more-than-what-we-think&#34;&gt;WHAT MATTERS MORE THAN WHAT WE THINK:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emotional stability and kindness are two of the most important and underrated characteristics needed for a good relationship
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emotional stability is measured based on how one reacts in stressful situations. Do they take time to think and respond or do they act impulsively and react.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Between stimulus and response is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom” - Victor Franco&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loyalty. You want someone who will stay with through think and thin. Old friendships in general indicate loyalty.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Growth mindset. A person with growth mindset doesn’t assume that talent is assigned at birth. They are much more likely to fight for the relationship when the problems eventually arise. Someone with growth mindset talks to themselves with self compassion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personality that brings out the best in you. How to evaluate? See how you feel after a date with them - energized, deflated, bored, desired, happy etc. After you go out with friends and her, ask your friends what do you think of me around her.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Skill to fight well. There are 2 types of problems. Solvable and perpetual. Key is to find a productive way to live with perpetual problems. Remember, when you choose a partner, you automatically choose a particular set of unreasonable problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;getting-out-there&#34;&gt;GETTING OUT THERE&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show a metric to people, they will think that’s important. People eventually try to optimize for the metrics we measure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Date smarter
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change your dating filters. Be more open minded on whom the dating app shows you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Swipe right on people who might be a maybe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What works for your dating profile:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Candid photos outperform posed by 15%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BnW photos outperform by 100% 😱&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For guys, have a standing photo looking into the camera smiling without teeth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A good profile should represent you, not an aspirational version of you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HOW TO MEET PEOPLE IRL
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to events. Evaluate events on these 2 metrics. 1. Likelihood that you will enjoy the event. 2. Likelihood that you will interact with people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Talk to people when standing in line&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to create better dates
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a pre date ritual&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose some place sexier. Like a candle lit wine bar instead of a well lit cafe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try sitting next to rather than across. It’s easier to open up when you are not making eye contact&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look for a fun activity to do together. A third object takes the pressure off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go on dates where you can see your date interact with others. Or where you need to collaborate like solving a puzzle.  This is a great way to observe those hard to measure qualities. More date ideas on loganury.com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On talking during dates: try entering with the middle part of story - instead of asking how is your day going, say something like ‘I just got off phone with my sister and she’s in the middle of an intense battle with her landlord’ - a shortcut to intimacy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;focus more on being interested than being interesting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People usually judge an experience based on how they felt during the most intense moment in the experience and at the end. So, order a dessert at the end or make a meaningful compliment just before you part ways&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support Vs shift responses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The post date aid - instead of having checklist, ask yourself following questions:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What side of me did they bring out&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How did my body feel during the date - stiff, relax or something in between&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do I feel energized or de-energized after the date&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there something about them that I’m curious about&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did they make me laugh&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did I feel heard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did I feel attractive in their presence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did I feel captivated or bored or something in between&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make going on 2nd dates a default rather than an exception&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;getting-serious&#34;&gt;GETTING SERIOUS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decide, don&amp;rsquo;t slide. It’s important to define the relationship (DTR) from time to time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Move deliberately and ensure other person is onboard with your expectations and understanding of the relationship&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take the wardrobe test of you are planning to break up. Answer to the following question should be quick and be coming out of gut feeling
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If your partner were to be a piece of clothing in your wardrobe, what would they be?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s usually a good sign if they are a fav shirt, or something like a jacket or shoes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Book Recommendation: The Artist’s way - an inspirational book that helps you reconnect with yourself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read the appropriate parts of the books for following things:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to decide if you should break up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to break up with someone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to overcome heartbreak&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to decide if you should marry?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go through the series of self reflection and conversational questions Logan suggests in the book before deciding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We usually are so fond of each other that we assume other person wants the same things as them and never talk about major decisions like where to live or to have kids&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

      <title>Man&#39;s Search for Meaning - Victor Frankl</title>
      <link>https://nevin-kollanoor.github.io/books/mans_search_for_meaning/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://nevin-kollanoor.github.io/books/mans_search_for_meaning/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For Success like happiness cannot be pursued, it must ensue. And it only does so as an unintended side effect of one’s personal dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as a byproduct of one’s surrender to a person other than oneself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are things that must cause you to leave your reason. Or you have none to lose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Between stimulus and response there is a space.  In that space is our power to choose our response.  In our response lies our growth and our freedom&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So live as if you were living already for the second time and as if you had acted the first time as wrongly as you are about to act now!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is to give light must endure burning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The one thing you can’t take away from me is the way I choose to respond to what you do to me. The last of one’s freedoms is to choose one’s attitude in any given circumstance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He who has a Why to live for can bear almost any How&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The meaning of life is unique to each individual and each moment. Asking the meaning of life as a generic question is same as asking a chess master what is the bet move in the world&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Love is the only way to grasp another human being in the innermost core of his personality. No one can become fully aware of the very essence of another human being unless he loves him. By his love he is enabled to see the essential traits and features in the beloved person; and even more, he sees that which is potential in him, which is not yet actualized but yet ought to be actualized. Furthermore, by his love, the loving person enables the beloved person to actualize these potentialities. By making him aware of what he can be and of what he should become, he makes these potentialities come true.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Existential Vacuum&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Predictably Irrational- Dan Ariely</title>
      <link>https://nevin-kollanoor.github.io/books/predictably_irrational/</link>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-decoy-effect&#34;&gt;1. Decoy Effect:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Often people don&amp;rsquo;t know what they want until these see things in context. Everything is relevant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we are always looking at things in relation to others. A perceived size of circle changes based on whether it&amp;rsquo;s placed among other smaller circles or bigger circles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is the reason why a print+online subscription is the best seller when you have a decoy option like print only for almost the same price&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We take the decision based on what we do know - print +online for 150$ is better than print only for 125$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introducing a new most expensive entree in a restaurant menu improves the sale of next most expensive entree&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;A man&amp;rsquo;s satisfaction with his salary depends on whether he makes more than his wife&amp;rsquo;s sister&amp;rsquo;s husband&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-arbitrary-coherence&#34;&gt;2. Arbitrary Coherence:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second price auction?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first seen price in a new product category serves as an anchor - as long as you seriously contemplate to buy it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is same reason why people are initially not willing to pay higher rents when they move to expensive cities even when their wages are calibrated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These anchors have an enduring affect and we see ourselves coming back to this anchor diet comparison&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The cost of zero cost&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zero is the source of emotional excitement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every transaction has an upside and a downside. Free transactions gives the illusion that there’s bio downside. Our high inclination to loss aversion makes it far more attractive than it actually is&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amazon saw an increase in AOV when it introduced free shipping above 20$. They saw this increase everywhere except in France where they charged a reduced fee of 20 cents for these high value orders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zero is not another discount, it’s a place. Difference between 2 and 1 is small. But the difference between 1 and zero is huge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;4-social-and-market-norms&#34;&gt;4. Social and Market norms&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People might work more for a cause than cash&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are 2 different worlds we live in. One where market norms apply and one where social norms apply&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once social norm meets the market norm, social norm goes away for a long long time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;5-influence-of-arousal&#34;&gt;5. Influence of arousal&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our inability to understand ourselves doesn’t improve with experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;6-problem-of-procrastination-and-self-control&#34;&gt;6. Problem of procrastination and self control&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resisting temptation and instilling self control are general human goals, and repeatedly failing to achieve them is the source of much of our misery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Road to hell is paved with good intentions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pre commitment (self imposed challenge) is one tool that solves this&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;7-the-high-price-of-ownership&#34;&gt;7. The high price of ownership&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When we own something, we start to value it more than others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Students who won a lottery to a basketball game were willing to sell it at 2400$ while while students who didn’t make the lottery were willing to buy at only 170$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We fall in love for what we already have&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In case of large transactions, approach it as if you are a non-owner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;8-why-options-distract-us-from-iit-main-objective&#34;&gt;8. Why options distract us from iit main objective&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Studies have shown that When given options, even if we know the expected value of each of these options, we still choose to explore 🤷🏻‍♂️&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;9-the-effect-of-expectations&#34;&gt;9. The effect of expectations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Previously held impressions affect the interpretation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you tell people in advance that something might be distasteful, odds are good that they will agree with you - because of their expectations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;10-the-power-of-price&#34;&gt;10. The power of price&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Price/cost can act as placebo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;12-why-dealing-with-cash-makes-us-more-honest&#34;&gt;12. Why dealing with cash makes us more honest:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the opportunity to cheat is in context of something that’s a few steps removed, or even one step removed from actual cash, we all cheat, to a greater extent at that&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is the reason why you see flagrant cheating in insurance claims, backdating stock options, audit books&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In these scenarios, we tend to rationalize and be dishonest by telling ourselves that e we are not being dishonest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;13-beer-and-free-lunches&#34;&gt;13. Beer and Free lunches&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When we order out loud in sequence, we tend to order a drink different to what others ordered on table&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Psychology of Money - Morgan Housel</title>
      <link>https://nevin-kollanoor.github.io/books/psychology_of_money/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://nevin-kollanoor.github.io/books/psychology_of_money/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;attitude-towards-money&#34;&gt;Attitude towards Money:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An individual&amp;rsquo;s capacity to bear risk depends on his/her personal history
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People who were born in 1950s have only seen the S&amp;amp;P500 being stagnated during their prime years. While the people born in 1970s have seen it rally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Their future financial decisions and views are very much dependent on this experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are rich and tall, your brother is more likely to be rich than tall&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The line between inspiringly bold and foolishly reckless can be just a millimeter thick and only visible through hindsight&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not all success is due to hardwork and not all poverty is due to laziness. Keep this in mind when you judge people and yourself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus less on specific individuals and more on broad patterns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The hardest financial skill is to getting the goal post to stop moving
Getting Money:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compounding: Ice ages are not caused by cool winters, but rather not hot enough summers, which accumulate over years and cover the entire earth with ice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The counter intuitiveness of compounding might be responsible for majority of all bad strategies aimed at successful investing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;91 year old Warren buffet started investing at the age of 11. Of his net worth of 84.5B $, 84.2B $ came after his 50th birthday and 81.5B $ came after his 60th birthday&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are A million ways to get wealthy but only a few ways to stay wealthy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first rule of compounding is to never interrupt it unnecessarily&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;staying-wealthy&#34;&gt;Staying Wealthy:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Traits required to stay wealthy:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Humility: fear that what you made can be taken away from you just as fast&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frugality: acceptance that attest some of what you made is attributed to luck&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4/10 public companies go bankrupt. Tail events drive majority of returns. Invest in portfolios!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People like to feel like they are in control&lt;/strong&gt;, that they are in the driver&amp;rsquo;s seat. When we get them to do something, they feel disempowered. Rather than feeling like they made the choice, it feels like we made it for them. So they say no or do something else even when they might have originality been happy to go along.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aligning money towards the life that let&amp;rsquo;s you do what you want when you want who you want and for as long as you want has incredible returns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of the ironies of money: Wealth is what you don&amp;rsquo;t see. Wealth is the expensive car not bought. Watches not worn. First class upgrades declined.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Way to be rich is to spend money you have and not spend money you don&amp;rsquo;t have. Quickest way to FEEL rich is to spend a lot of money on expensive items&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of the powerful ways to improve savings isn&amp;rsquo;t to raise income, but to raise humility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After a certain level of income, savings = income-ego
Deal with Financial Anxiety and manage expectations:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not aim to be coldly rational when making financial decisions. Aim to just be pretty reasonable. Reasonable is more realistic and you have a better chance of sticking with it for the long run, which is what matters most when managing money&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Things that never happened in history, happen all the time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focusing on past history and past patterns may cause two things:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overlooking outlier events that move the needle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Misreading the present by looking to the past because the past DOESN’T account for the structural changes that are relevant in today’s world&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“This is not a failure of analysis. It’s a failure of imagination.” It is difficult (takes a special kind of skill) to imagine a future that looks nothing like today or anything we have seen before.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look at the down swings in portfolio as the fee for investments with good returns - not as fine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thinking market volatility as a fee rather than a fine is an important part of developing the mindset that let&amp;rsquo;s you stick around long enough for investing gains to play in your favor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pessimism sounds smarter and more plausible. It gains more attention&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Appealing fiction: when you want something to be true, you tend to believe stories that overestimate the odds of that being true&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;authors-notes&#34;&gt;Author&amp;rsquo;s notes:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Morgan Housel&amp;rsquo;s notion: &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m a passive investor who believes in world&amp;rsquo;s ability to generate real economic growth, I&amp;rsquo;m confident that over the next 30 years growth will accrue to my investments&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go out of your way to find humility when things go right and forgiveness and compassion when things go wrong&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Key points:  humility, less ego, wealth vs. riches, financial decisions that offer peace of mind, use the power of time and consistency, accept failure and risk, strive for time freedom, frugality, make saving a core habit, be prepared to pay the price required for successful outcomes, prepare a margin of safety, avoid extremes, define the game you’re playing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;post-script-how-americans-think-about-money&#34;&gt;Post script: How Americans Think About Money&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;US post WW2 had 16 million (11%) serve during the war. Of which 8m were oversees on Aug&#39;45. Their avg age was 23. Almost all of them came home in few months and are out of uniform&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Concerns:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;lt;12k homes per month were built in 1941-45 period. Returning soldiers needed home&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many jobs created for war needs like ship building have come to a halt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marriage rates during and post war has spiked. All want to start a family in a new home with a good job right away.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Full scale depression was predicted for the coming 4 years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;US Fed had reduced interest rates in 1941 to .38%. Although this was done to finance the war, they continued to hold this policy. 3-month treasury yields stayed below 2% till mid 1950s&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consumption became an explicit economic strategy. Govt encouraged spending. Mortgages were given out with almost no down payment at ow rates. Interest on all loans including Credit card were tax deductible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;US household debt raised from 25B $ in &amp;lsquo;45 to 125B $ in &amp;lsquo;55 to 331$ B in &amp;lsquo;65&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What worked was that great depression created good productivity in American industries. This enabled them to produce new innovative household items in crazy speed. The jobs created with this were also good jobs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gains are shared more equally. Average wages steadily raised. Gap between rich and poor has narrowed. Everyone started living equally well&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everything in Finance is in the context of expectations. Expectation in US now is that person in 50th percentile of earning should live a life not too different from a person in 90th percentile&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recession hit in &amp;lsquo;73. Story since then is the growth continued, but in an uneven manner, yet people&amp;rsquo;s expectations about lifestyle remained the same&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2008 recession is a paradigm of this mindset.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a world with such sharp inequality, success isn&amp;rsquo;t as meritocratic as it used to be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

      <title>Rich Dad Poor Dad - Robert Kiyosaki</title>
      <link>https://nevin-kollanoor.github.io/books/rich_dad_poor_dad/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://nevin-kollanoor.github.io/books/rich_dad_poor_dad/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Rich dad lessons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rich don’t work for money. Savers are losers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your house is not an asset&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How the rich pay less taxes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can’t afford it (vs) How can I afford it
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can’t afford it is a statement and it immediately shuts the brain down. How can I afford it asks a question. This small change keeps the brain engaged and align thoughts accordingly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ch1---the-rich-dont-work-for-the-money&#34;&gt;CH1 - The rich don’t work for the money&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ch2---why-teach-financial-literacy&#34;&gt;CH2 - Why teach Financial literacy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buy Assets, not liabilities, and you’ll be rich&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The rich buy assets, the poor only have expenses, the middle class buy liabilities that they think are assets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lack of financial literacy means wealth does not stay with you. Lottery winners often end up broke soon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The 21st century illiterate is not the one who can’t read, but the one who can’t learn, unlearn and relearn&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Money without intelligence is money soon gone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ch3---mind-your-own-business&#34;&gt;CH3 - Mind your own business&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your profession is different from your business. If you work at HSBC, it means you are making money for HSBC’s business. You do not own a business&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your business revolves around your asset, not your income.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once a dollar goes into your asset, it becomes your employee. It works 24x7 and can work for generations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acquire the type of assets you love. That way you will take better care of them and enjoy learning about them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ch4-history-of-taxes&#34;&gt;CH4-History of taxes:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taxes used to be temporary, often used to finance wars.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 1874 England permanently levied income taxes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 1913, with the 16th amendment, US made taxes permanent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These taxes were accepted by majority because they were first levied only on the rich. Although it was designed to punish the rich, it ended up punishing the poor and the middle class&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But just because of how the incentives are aligned - where a private organization tries to save money and under cut budgets, a government body tries to exhaust its budgets and employ more people. Hence Government’s appetite for taxes kept increasing and the burden tripled down to middle class and poor too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Corporations pay their expenses before paying taxes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Corporations: Earn-&amp;gt;spend-&amp;gt;pay taxes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Employees: Earn-&amp;gt;pay taxes-&amp;gt;spend&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ch5---the-rich-invent-the-money&#34;&gt;CH5 - The rich invent the money&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Often in the world is not the smart who get ahead but the bold&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tier financial success requires both technical knowledge and courage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ch6---work-to-learn---dont-work-for-money&#34;&gt;Ch6 - Work to learn - Don’t work for money&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ch7---overcoming-obstacles&#34;&gt;Ch7 - Overcoming obstacles&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A very common form of laziness - avoiding something important by keeping busy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Answer for this kind of laziness - a little bit of greed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Greed is good. Guilt is worse than greed, for guilt Rob’s the body of its soul.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do what you feel at your heart to be right, for your Will be criticized anyway. Dammed if you do, dammed if you don’t.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

      <title>Things you can see when you slow down - Haemin Sunim</title>
      <link>https://nevin-kollanoor.github.io/books/things_you_see/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://nevin-kollanoor.github.io/books/things_you_see/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;rest&#34;&gt;REST&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not that the world is objectively joyful or sad and produces the corresponding feeling in us. Feelings originate with the mind projecting it&amp;rsquo;s subjective experience on to the world&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our reality is not the infinitely expanding cosmos. But the small part we choose to focus on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not the situations that are troubling us, but our perspective on it. Tsunamies are terrifying not just because of the water, but because of the objects that are hurled at us. We feel unhappy not just because of what happened, but because of the swirling thoughts of what happened.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t struggle to heal your wounds. Just pour time into your heart and wait. When the wounds are ready, they will heal on their own.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask yourself how your work helps others regardless of how insignificantly or indirectly. As you focus more on others, you can reconnect with the meaning and purpose for your work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With love in our hearts, you will find the most mundane things beautiful. Without love in our hearts, we find the world meaningless, and random. Without love in our hearts, we will become strangers even to our family and friends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t give up upon receiving criticism. Brush aside what people who don&amp;rsquo;t know you have to say.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Life teaches us through our mistakes. When you make a mistake, simply ask yourself what you are meant to learn from it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;mindfulness&#34;&gt;MINDFULNESS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When people who don&amp;rsquo;t know you well admire you, they are seeing their projected illusion not your real self. In contrast when people who know you well respect you, it&amp;rsquo;s probably because you deserve it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you push back against an unchangeable no, you will suffer in the process and miss other opportunities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The entirety of an enlightened person can be summarized into &amp;lsquo;complete acceptance to what is&amp;rsquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Evaluating the present through the memories of the past can cause sadness. Change is inevitable, embrace it and welcome it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our consciousness may desire money, power and prestige. But the subconscious desires selfless love, harmony, humour, beauty, sacredness, peace and acceptance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;passion&#34;&gt;PASSION&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a mistake to equate our own eagerness with effectiveness. Getting the job done well is more important than one&amp;rsquo;s feeling a of doing a good job.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One&amp;rsquo;s own zealous efforts can sometimes get in the way of achieving the desired outcome especially if one is not able to see the needs of others working together&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s dangerous to have passion without wisdom&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A vow to help others can immense energy from inside&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many conflicts can be resolved if we try to look at things from the other&amp;rsquo;s pov.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you get angry while debating right and wrong, your enraged voice just conceded defeat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;relationships&#34;&gt;RELATIONSHIPS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conversations tend to become boring when we are in the clutches of politeness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;love&#34;&gt;LOVE&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be as gentle in ending a relationship, as you were starting it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anger without reason, could be an indication of crush&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;life&#34;&gt;LIFE&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write down the things that you want to do for yourself before you die and do it one by one. No one needs to know about it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dream big, start small&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your thoughts become your words, words become your behavior, behaviors become your habits, your habits become your values and your values become your destiny. So keep them positive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When our greed is awakened, we are cheated. Swindlers use this often&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The reward for someone who works hard is more work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we are quick to grant a favor, people quickly forget their gratitude. If we grant a favor with several conditions, then people express immense gratitude.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-future&#34;&gt;THE FUTURE&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Live your life not to satisfy others, but to fulfill your own desires&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Life isn&amp;rsquo;t a 100 meter race against your friends, but a life long marathon against yourself. Don&amp;rsquo;t be disappointed that you are slightly behind&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself &amp;ldquo;I will not spend today passively, doing what others ask me to do. I will take the lead and forge my own destiny&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Establish a goal for the week. A significant accomplishment can be traced back to a single thought.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;About career choices - The truth is that other people do not really think about you that much. If you think you will enjoy something, don&amp;rsquo;t overthink it. Just do it. Even if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t turn out to be what you thought it would be, you will appreciate what it taught you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</description>
