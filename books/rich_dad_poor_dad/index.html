Rich don’t work for money. Savers are losers
Your house is not an asset
How the rich pay less taxes

INTRODUCTION

I can’t afford it (vs) How can I afford it

I can’t afford it is a statement and it immediately shuts the brain down. How can I afford it asks a question. This small change keeps the brain engaged and align thoughts accordingly



CH1 - The rich don’t work for the money
CH2 - Why teach Financial literacy

Buy Assets, not liabilities, and you’ll be rich
The rich buy assets, the poor only have expenses, the middle class buy liabilities that they think are assets
Lack of financial literacy means wealth does not stay with you. Lottery winners often end up broke soon
The 21st century illiterate is not the one who can’t read, but the one who can’t learn, unlearn and relearn

Money without intelligence is money soon gone

CH3 - Mind your own business

Your profession is different from your business. If you work at HSBC, it means you are making money for HSBC’s business. You do not own a business
Your business revolves around your asset, not your income.
Once a dollar goes into your asset, it becomes your employee. It works 24x7 and can work for generations
Acquire the type of assets you love. That way you will take better care of them and enjoy learning about them

CH4-History of taxes:

Taxes used to be temporary, often used to finance wars.
In 1874 England permanently levied income taxes
In 1913, with the 16th amendment, US made taxes permanent
These taxes were accepted by majority because they were first levied only on the rich. Although it was designed to punish the rich, it ended up punishing the poor and the middle class
But just because of how the incentives are aligned - where a private organization tries to save money and under cut budgets, a government body tries to exhaust its budgets and employ more people. Hence Government’s appetite for taxes kept increasing and the burden tripled down to middle class and poor too.

Corporations pay their expenses before paying taxes
Corporations: Earn->spend->pay taxes
Employees: Earn->pay taxes->spend

CH5 - The rich invent the money

Often in the world is not the smart who get ahead but the bold
Tier financial success requires both technical knowledge and courage

Ch6 - Work to learn - Don’t work for money
Ch7 - Overcoming obstacles

A very common form of laziness - avoiding something important by keeping busy
Answer for this kind of laziness - a little bit of greed.
Greed is good. Guilt is worse than greed, for guilt Rob’s the body of its soul.
Do what you feel at your heart to be right, for your Will be criticized anyway. Dammed if you do, dammed if you don’t.
