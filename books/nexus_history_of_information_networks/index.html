Consider this naive view: in sufficient quantities, information leads to truth. Truth in turn leads to both power and wisdom.

PART 1: HUMAN NETWORKS
Chapter 1: What is Information

What is truth? Truth isn&rsquo;t a one to one account of reality. Truth is something that brings our attention to certain aspects of the reality while inevitably ignoring other aspects.
No account of reality is 100% accurate. But nevertheless, some accounts are more truthful than others
Cher Ami story and its branding
The naive view assumes that the solution to misinformation and disinformation is more information (this idea is sometimes called counter speech doctrine).
It assumes that in long term, free discussion is bound to expose falsehoods and fallacies.
Viewing information as a social Nexus, helps us understand many aspects of human history that confound the naive view of information as a depredation of reality. Prime example is the significance of Bible in human history.
Information sometimes represents reality and sometimes doesn&rsquo;t. But it always connects.
The very first and important information technology we ever developed is Stories.

Chapter 2: Stories

Story based network gave Homo sapiens huge edge in evolution.
The history of human information networks in a tight rope walk trying to balance truth and order.
Contrary to what the mission statements of corporations like Google and Facebook imply, simply increasing the speed and efficiency of our information technology doesn&rsquo;t necessarily make the world a better place. It only makes the need to balance the truth and order more urgent

Chapter 3: Documents

The 2nd greatest invention of information technology: written documents
Bureaucracy often sacrifices truth for order.
Bureaucracy literally means rule from desk.
Mythology and bureaucracy are 2 pillars of any large scale society.
Killing the documents erased the debts. Many historical rebellions were motivated by this. Ex: During the great Jewish revolt in 66CE, rebels set fire to central archives to erase debts and thereby winning the populous support. Same thing happened during the French revolution in 18th century

Chapter 4: Errors; The Fantasy of Infallibility

Humans are susceptible to adopting fake memories
Witch hunt was a catastrophe caused by the spread of toxic information
Witch hunt is the prime example of a problem that was created by information and was made more worse by more information
A completely free market of ideas may incentivize the dissemination of outrage and sensationalism at the expense of truth. This is because printers and booksellers made lot more money from the lurid tales of the Hammer of the witches than they did from the dumb mathematics of Copernicus&rsquo;s On the revolution of heavenly spheres (published 1543)
Copernicus&rsquo;s book is considered to be foundational for modern science with shattering discoveries about how the universe works. But it is dubbed as an All time worstseller, with only releasing 3 editions in 100 years.
What really got the scientific revolution going was neither the printing press nor a completely free market of information. Discovery of Ignorance
Curation Institutions! These had strong self correcting mechanisms. These self correcting mechanisms and not the printing system that formed the engines of scientific revolution
Holy books are supposed to be infallible. But Self correcting mechanisms embrace fallibility.

Chapter 5: Decisions and Brief History of Democracies and Totalitarianism

Instead of viewing democracy and dictatorship as contrasting political and ethical ideologies, let&rsquo;s look at them as contrasting types of information networks.
Dictatorship is centralized information network with no self correcting mechanisms. Democracy is a distributed information network with strong self correcting mechanisms
One of the core features of a democracy is that it assumes everyone is fallible. Hence, while it gives power to center to make some vital decisions, they also maintain strong mechanisms to challenge the authority of the center.
Just like how modern technology enabled large scale democracies, it also made large scale totalitarianism possible.
In Autocracy there is no legal limit to what the center can do. But there are technical limits which do not let them have a totalitarian rule. Modern technology solves these technical problems.
Nero got his mother and mentor killed and ruled as a ruthless dictator. Although he may have dreamed of influencing the thoughts and opinions of a farmer in Gaul, there were no means back then for him to do this.
Qin dynasty tried implementing a totalitarian regime. They had a system where reporting someone who bad mouthed the authority would be incentivized and promoted in social hierarchy and the dissenters strongly punished. But this form didn&rsquo;t survive. 15 years into their apogee, Qin dynasty was overthrown by a revolution which divided them into 18 individual kingdoms which was later united by Han dynasty. Han ensured that they did not try to influence people&rsquo;s thoughts and beliefs and created a system that&rsquo;s inspired from Confusicous
Totalitarianism did not start with Stalin, he merely perfected it. The Bolshevik totalitarianism stemmed from party infallibility.
Early modern European witch hunters worked in autocratic societies that lacked the modern information technology. Therefore it took them 3 centuries to kill 50,000 alleged witches. In contrast, Soviets had telegram, telephones and radios which enabled them to eliminate millions of Kulaks (wealthy capitalistic peasants) in just 2 years
Technology doesn&rsquo;t cause a certain regime. It only creates new opportunities. It is up to us, which ones to pursue.

PART II: THE INORGANIC NETWORK
Chapter 6: How Computers are Different from Printing Presses

Intelligence vs consciousness: Common misconception is that non conscious entities cannot be intelligent. Intelligence is the ability to attain goals - like maximizing user engagement on the social media platform. Consciousness is the ability to experience the subjective feelings like pain, pleasure, love and hate. In humans and other mammals, intelligence goes hand in hand with consciousness.
Until computers came in, all information networks required humans as connections. Some networks only had humans in them. But not anymore
Democracy is a conversation. And conversations rely on language. By hacking language, computers could make it extremely difficult for large numbers of people to conduct a meaningful conversation.
What new changes can we expect in the information networks? It will still contain human to human chains (families) and human to document chains (Churches). But it will increasingly contain:

New Human to computer chains emerge (Facebook, TikTok). They can deepfake intimacy. Bible had a profound impact on billions of people even though it was a mute document. Now imagine the effect of a holy book that not only can talk and listen, but can get to know your deepest fears and hopes, and constantly would use them.
Computer to computer chains (new encryption methods). Humans are excluded from these chains and would often find it difficult to understand what&rsquo;s happening in these chains. Google brain conducted an experiment where they employed a third computer to monitor and interpret the comms between 2 computers with incentive structure. After 15k exchanges, the two computers came up with their own language despite not being trained on encryption.


Evaluating AI based on human level intelligence is like defining and evaluating airplanes through the metric of bird level flight. AI is not progressing towards human level intelligence, it&rsquo;s evolving an entirely different level of intelligence.
Corporations that head the computer revolution tend to shift the blame to customers, voters, politicians, regulators.
We are moving from an economy dominated by money transactions to an economy dominated by information transactions. How should states react? Should they start taxing the information based currency?
Politics and policy has the power to dictate the use of information technology. Although both East and West Germany radios could tune into a wide variety of frequencies, East Germany did its best to jam the broadcasts from the west and punished people who secretly tuned into them. Technology is same but politics made the difference.

Chapter 7: The Network is Always On

When humans monitored humans, privacy was the default. But when computers monitor humans, privacy might altogether be annihilated.
Advent of computers put us in a network that&rsquo;s always on. Hijab monitoring in Iran, peer to peer review system of restaurants are all examples of this.
When CeauÈ™escu wanted to know who was responsible for writing anonymous letters to western radio media, he ordered the entire Romania to submit hand written notes so that enormous amount of bureaucrats can analyze these samples to identify the culprits. In today&rsquo;s world, tracing someone is an easy thing to do that doesn&rsquo;t require employing thousands of bureaucrats.
The network being always on means humans can&rsquo;t disconnect and relax. An organism that can&rsquo;t rest disintegrates and dies.

Chapter 8: Network is Often Wrong

Information is often created to create order than to discover truth.
Algorithms impose new orders despite the social media giants&rsquo; claims that they are mere moderators and government, voters and policy makers are responsible for building the social system.
Just been difficult to get an alignment from humans in bureaucracy which divide a gold and is going to be even more to get that alignment with computer Computer network it&rsquo;s going to be far more often than bureaucracy
2014 book the philosopher, super intelligence had to start experiment where a paperclip company hire a super computer and the manager at the paper factory instructed the computer to produce as many paper clips as possible, and then the computer goes on to conquer and I will eliminate a human and fill the galaxy with the paper

Just like how modern technology enabled large scale democracies, it also made large scale totalitarianism possible. In Autocracy there is no legal limit to what the center can do. But there are technical limits which do not let them have a totalitarian rule. Modern technology solves these technical problems. Nero got his mother and mentor killed and ruled as a ruthless dictator. Although he may have dreamed of influencing the thoughts and opinions of a farmer in Gaul, there were no means back then for him to do this. Qin dynasty tried implementing a totalitarian regime. They had a system where reporting someone who bad mouthed the authority would be incentivized and promoted in social hierarchy and the dissenters strongly punished. But this form didn\u0026rsquo;t survive. 15 years into their apogee, Qin dynasty was overthrown by a revolution which divided them into 18 individual kingdoms which was later united by Han dynasty. Han ensured that they did not try to influence people\u0026rsquo;s thoughts and beliefs and created a system that\u0026rsquo;s inspired from Confusicous Totalitarianism did not start with Stalin, he merely perfected it. The Bolshevik totalitarianism stemmed from party infallibility. Early modern European witch hunters worked in autocratic societies that lacked the modern information technology. Therefore it took them 3 centuries to kill 50,000 alleged witches. In contrast, Soviets had telegram, telephones and radios which enabled them to eliminate millions of Kulaks (wealthy capitalistic peasants) in just 2 years Technology doesn\u0026rsquo;t cause a certain regime.

Truth in turn leads to both power and wisdom. PART 1: HUMAN NETWORKS Chapter 1: What is Information What is truth? Truth isnâ€™t a one to one account of reality. Truth is something that brings our attention to certain aspects of the reality while inevitably ignoring other aspects. No account of reality is 100% accurate. But nevertheless, some accounts are more truthful than others Cher Ami story and its branding The naive view assumes that the solution to misinformation and disinformation is more information (this idea is sometimes called counter speech doctrine). It assumes that in long term, free discussion is bound to expose falsehoods and fallacies. Viewing information as a social Nexus, helps us understand many aspects of human history that confound the naive view of information as a depredation of reality. Prime example is the significance of Bible in human history. Information sometimes represents reality and sometimes doesnâ€™t. But it always connects. The very first and important information technology we ever developed is Stories. Chapter 2: Stories Story based network gave Homo sapiens huge edge in evolution. The history of human information networks in a tight rope walk trying to balance truth and order. Contrary to what the mission statements of corporations like Google and Facebook imply, simply increasing the speed and efficiency of our information technology doesnâ€™t necessarily make the world a better place. It only makes the need to balance the truth and order more urgent Chapter 3: Documents The 2nd greatest invention of information technology: written documents Bureaucracy often sacrifices truth for order. Bureaucracy literally means rule from desk. Mythology and bureaucracy are 2 pillars of any large scale society. Killing the documents erased the debts. Many historical rebellions were motivated by this. Ex: During the great Jewish revolt in 66CE, rebels set fire to central archives to erase debts and thereby winning the populous support. Same thing happened during the French revolution in 18th century Chapter 4: Errors; The Fantasy of Infallibility Humans are susceptible to adopting fake memories Witch hunt was a catastrophe caused by the spread of toxic information Witch hunt is the prime example of a problem that was created by information and was made more worse by more information A completely free market of ideas may incentivize the dissemination of outrage and sensationalism at the expense of truth. This is because printers and booksellers made lot more money from the lurid tales of the Hammer of the witches than they did from the dumb mathematics of Copernicusâ€™s On the revolution of heavenly spheres (published 1543) Copernicusâ€™s book is considered to be foundational for modern science with shattering discoveries about how the universe works. But it is dubbed as an All time worstseller, with only releasing 3 editions in 100 years. What really got the scientific revolution going was neither the printing press nor a completely free market of information. Discovery of Ignorance Curation Institutions! These had strong self correcting mechanisms. These self correcting mechanisms and not the printing system that formed the engines of scientific revolution Holy books are supposed to be infallible. But Self correcting mechanisms embrace fallibility. Chapter 5: Decisions and Brief History of Democracies and Totalitarianism Instead of viewing democracy and dictatorship as contrasting political and ethical ideologies, letâ€™s look at them as contrasting types of information networks. Dictatorship is centralized information network with no self correcting mechanisms. Democracy is a distributed information network with strong self correcting mechanisms One of the core features of a democracy is that it assumes everyone is fallible. Hence, while it gives power to center to make some vital decisions, they also maintain strong mechanisms to challenge the authority of the center. Just like how modern technology enabled large scale democracies, it also made large scale totalitarianism possible. In Autocracy there is no legal limit to what the center can do. But there are technical limits which do not let them have a totalitarian rule. Modern technology solves these technical problems.

They had a system where reporting someone who bad mouthed the authority would be incentivized and promoted in social hierarchy and the dissenters strongly punished. But this form didnâ€™t survive. 15 years into their apogee, Qin dynasty was overthrown by a revolution which divided them into 18 individual kingdoms which was later united by Han dynasty. Han ensured that they did not try to influence peopleâ€™s thoughts and beliefs and created a system thatâ€™s inspired from Confusicous Totalitarianism did not start with Stalin, he merely perfected it. The Bolshevik totalitarianism stemmed from party infallibility. Early modern European witch hunters worked in autocratic societies that lacked the modern information technology.
